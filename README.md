# flightAPI
API for flight search

This application is a flight search tool built as part of a challenge. Itâ€™s developed with FastAPI, which enables high performance. For package management, I used Poetry. The application is fully containerized and organized with a simple, clear, and readable structure. Please note that I completed this within the estimated timeframe, focusing on the core requirements of the challenge; with more time, i could have added CI/CD pipelines, configured it to run in pods, and set up deployment.


# Instructions for setup the application

Run the following commands

1. **make up** (build and up the application)
2. **make migrate** (migrate the initial migration)
3. **make load-data** (load test data)

and done! that's all, with that commands you can set up the application and try it.

you can run tests with **make test** too.
